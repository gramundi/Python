Due to Xavier Ribera¿s email from July 7th, 2011, (¿All these studies were sent to medical affairs corporate and evaluated by the IIB/IV W group. The problem is that some of them (most) were sent to Steven Kesten and endorsed out of the IIB/IV WG meeting (of-line?) , others to Armin or  Fee and the endorsement answer has been always by e-mail (some of them in the middle of other subjects). Also some of them have been managed  by Pfizer Spain. The result is that I did not keep the e-mails and I do not have written (official) confirmation of the endorsement. I have all the protocols in English because we sent them to corporate for evaluation (all of them). I do not know if Steven kept the records or some of them are in the 3b4 minutes.¿) and records retention it is not possible to prove whether the NTA is officially released by Corporate and the Spiriva IIIb/IV Working Group, respectively.,,,,

This will seriously slow down the enrollment.    07-MAR-2008.  Protocol is in signature stage now.  ICFs are being reviewed by DRA.   (5-FEB-2008) The budget well reflected under OPU/Grants.  CTMS does not recognize pre-screening from enrolled, and i need to find a solution to resove this issue so that i can adjust TCM budget items. 

(5-FEB-2008)  Final draft of protocol was submitted to PRC on 4-FEB-2008.  Budget was revised based on current assumptions, taking into consideration the worst case scenario of needing to prescreen 1200 patients at a 5% FISH positive rate overall.
Design of this trial has been very much dependent on the logistics of the pre-screening.   After much brainstorming, the trial team, along with TMM chose to limit this trial to two to three sites at most, MGH, Dana Farber and Beth Isreal NYC, reduced the number of patients to 48 from original 60.   This will still pose several issues, most importantly MGH's ability to enroll patients, along with Dana Farber in 18 months.   Enrolling 48 patients requires pre-screening of 600-1200 patients to find those who test positive for EGFR/HER2 gene amplification.

STIM took place on 02-NOV-2007.
